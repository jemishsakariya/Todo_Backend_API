# Todo_Backend_API
This repository contains the backend API implementation for a todo application built using Express.js and MongoDB. The API provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing todos.

# Features
• Express.js Framework: Built using the popular Express.js framework for Node.js, providing a robust foundation for handling HTTP requests, middleware, and routing.

• MongoDB Integration: Seamlessly integrates with MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, to store and retrieve todo data.

# Getting Started
To run the backend API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the MongoDB connection & PORT in the `.env` file.
4. Start the server: `npm start` \
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; OR
4. Start the nodemon server: `npm run dev`

# Testing the API with Postman
You can test the API endpoints using Postman. Here are the steps:

1. Open Postman or your preferred API testing tool.
2. Set the API base URL to http://localhost:3000 or the appropriate URL where the server is running.
3. Send requests to the API endpoints listed in the Postman collection to perform CRUD operations on todos.
